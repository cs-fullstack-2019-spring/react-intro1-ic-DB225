# React in-classwork

### Exercise 1:
Create a new React application using ```create-react-app``` called ```students```. Create a React Class component called ```StudentAccount``` that accepts the properties ```firstName``` and ```grade``` that when rendered will output ```STUDENT_NAME's current grade is STUDENT-GRADE```.

### Exercise 2:
Create a new React application using ```create-react-app``` called ```colors```. Create a top level React component called ```Colors``` that doesn't accept any properties. Create 3 additional React components ```red```, ```green```, and ```blue``` each of which simply returns the name of each color with a font color equal to their name.

Render the ```Colors``` component from the main ```app.js``` and have the ```Colors``` component render each of the 3 other components.
